# Lessons learned

 - When scan lines have long streaks to the right or left
    - check to make sure you're adding by the right dx for the right xcor

# New

 - Scanline conversion
 - Z-buffer
 - A new Drawer class (aka struct) that make it easier to do procedural drawing (make drawing in the program itself a lot similar to the script)
